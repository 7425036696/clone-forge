# clone-forge
CloneForge is a website that lets users enter the URL of any website and generate an editable version of it. After cloning the site’s layout, design, and structure, users can replace the logo, name, colors, text or any other element. Once the changes are done, the project can be exported as clean code in HTML/CSS, React, or Next.js formats.
